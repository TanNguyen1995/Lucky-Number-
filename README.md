# Lucky-Number-
This game will have the following basic functions:

The system will automatically generate a random number between 0 and maximum (which is a predefined constant). For example: maximum is 100 then the lucky number will be a random natural number between 0 and 100.
Then the player will be entered any number that they think coincides with the lucky number - lucky number.
If the user enters a higher number than the lucky number, the program will display: the lucky number is smaller than your prediction.
If the user enters a lower number than the lucky number, the program will display: the lucky number is greater than your prediction.
If the user enters the correct number as the lucky number, the program will display: congratulations, you have guessed the lucky number correctly after x guesses. Where, x is the number of times the user has predicted this turn.
